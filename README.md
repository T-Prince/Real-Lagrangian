# Real-Lagrangian

This repository contains the magma code used in the project 'Real Lagrangians in Calabi-Yau threefolds' (arXiv:1908.06685).

Note that as of 09/12/19 this repository only contains source code associated with arXiv:1908.06685.
Cech cohomology computations for the related article 'On Real Lagrangians in Quintic Threefolds' (arXiv:1807.10172)
have been removed while these are undergoing revision.

The file 'triple_intersection.m' can be tested at http://magma.maths.usyd.edu.au/calc/ and computes
the rank of the 101x101 matrix representing the linear map D -> D^2 which appears in Example 4.11 of arXiv:1908.06685.
